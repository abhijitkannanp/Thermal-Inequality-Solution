# Amrit-Vayu: The Urban Thermal Shield 🛡️🌡️

**AI for Bharat Hackathon 2026** *Engineering "Thermal Equality" for India's Street Economy.*

## 🌟 The Vision
Amrit-Vayu is a decentralized, autonomous Micro-Climate Adaptive Grid. It moves beyond passive heat monitoring to **active physical mitigation**, protecting outdoor workers from lethal "Heat Islands" that are 10°C hotter than reported city averages.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Predictive Heat Triggers:** AWS SageMaker predicts spikes 30-60 mins ahead.
- **Autonomous Cooling:** Real-time activation of misting and smart-shading.
- **Cool-Corridor API:** Navigation for citizens based on shade and thermal safety.
- **Bharat-First Design:** Low-cost (₹1,500/node), offline-resilient, and multilingual.
